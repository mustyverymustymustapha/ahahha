Welcome to my random coding language generator! This project was created and made in about 6-7 hours (I am a slow coder).
Basically, this is just a little tool that helps you choose the coding language for your next project! (Granted you know many languages).
You just have to click on the main button and it generates you a random coding language from a variety of them. This can be the coding language for your next project!
There is also an easter egg I (tried to) hide with a picture of a cat. It's a little reward for checking this project out!
This was quickly shaped up, so feel free to give any feedback. I'm dumb after all. 
Anyway, this project chooses from an array of the following coding languages, some old, some forgotten, some easy, some hard, some popular.
"JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C++", "Ruby",
    "Go", "Swift", "Kotlin", "TypeScript", "Rust",
    "PHP", "C#", "Scala", "Dart", "Haskell",
    "Lua", "R", "Julia", "Erlang", "Clojure",
    "F#", "Elixir", "Groovy", "Perl", "COBOL"
